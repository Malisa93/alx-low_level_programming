0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
0. memset
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
Returns a pointer to the memory area s
1. memcpy
Write a function that copies memory area.
The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
Returns a pointer to dest
2. strchr
Write a function that locates a character in a string.
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
3. strspn
I will Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
4. strpbrk
I will write a function that searches a string for any set of bytes.
The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found
5. strstr
i will Write a function that locates a substring.
The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
6. Chess is mental torture
I will Write a function that prints the chessboard.
7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire
I will Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
Prototype: void print_diagsums(int *a, int size);
